Learning Activities & Resources
This week’s activity I made a basic website based on a made up bakery with three pages that link to each other. The practical was more of a refresher for web development and just using the basics to make up a website. I used github pages because for some reason Siteground won’t let me make an account.

Estimated Hours
About 4 hours this week

Content Insights
The videos on linkedin touched on topics that I have heard of from other subjects and from using the internet myself, however it still introduced new things to me. The new things were related to content management systems, which I feel will be very helpful in this subject as I believe I will be able to improve my knowledge and abilities related to web development.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights
With it being the first week of this subject and realising it really isn’t like any other subject I feel that I need to change the way I learn the content and apply what I know to the tasks ahead. One of my concerns coming to the end of this degree is employability and wondering how this degree would even prepare me for the real workforce. I can see that this subject will address my concerns and help me become more capable in becoming an independent learner and worker. Reflecting on the practical given in week 1 and realising that there is no hand holding or step-by-step process I get the freedom to tackle the task in whatever way I see fit. So long as I meet the requirements of the task.
